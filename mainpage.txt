/**
 * @mainpage MDStressLab++
 *
 * @section overview Overview
 *
 * **MDStressLab++** is a KIM-compliant program for postprocessing molecular dynamics (MD)
 * or molecular statics (MS) simulations to compute atomistic stress fields using
 * different definitions of the atomistic stress tensor.
 * 
 * For more information on KIM (Knowledgebase of Interatomic Models), see
 * [openkim.org](https://openkim.org).
 * 
 * MDStressLab++ provides the following capabilities:
 *
 * - Compute the **Cauchy** and **first Piola-Kirchhoff** versions of the **Hardy** and **virial** stress tensors on a user-defined grid.
 *   See @cite AdmalTadmor2010, @cite AdmalTadmor2011, @cite AdmalTadmor2016a.
 * - Integrated Python tools for visualizing stress fields. See @ref visualization_intro "Visualization Utilities".

 @section features Key Features
 *
 * - **LAMMPS compatibility**: Atomistic configurations can be read from LAMMPS-style `dump` files.
 * - **No `process_dedr` required**: Atomistic stress can be computed even for interatomic potentials
 *   that do not provide interatomic forces derived from the derivatives of
 *   energy with respect to distances. 
 * - **Flexible weight functions via CRTP**: User-defined weighting functions can be implemented easily
 *   by inheriting from the `Method` template class using the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP).
 * - **Lattice-dependent averaging domains**: Reduced noise is achieved by using 
 *   lattice-dependent averaging domains. See @cite AdmalTadmorShi2019.
 * - **Library or script mode**: MDStressLab++ can be used as a C++ library within custom applications
 *   or driven by user-defined input scripts for standard workflows.
