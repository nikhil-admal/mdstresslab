# Input file for MDStressLab++ to generate the Cauchy stress field
# on a grid for a configuration read in from a LAMMPS data file using
# an interatomic potential from the OpenKIM repository
#
# Calculations will be accelerated using OpenMP parallelism if available.
# To specify the number of threads, set the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS
# If not set, all available processors will be used.

# Stress calculation type, options:
#    project : local project method
#    chain   : chain rule approach (available for only some KIM models)
#
project

# Number of grids on which to compute stress
#
1

# For each grid the following information:
#
#    domain, size, option
#    xl, yl, zl, xu, yu, zu, ngridx, ngridy, ngridz, d
#
# where
#
#    domain: shape of the averaging domain - sphere or ldad
#    size: size of the averaging domain - diameter of the sphere or ldad cube size
#    option: project or chain
#    xl, yl, zl : coordinates of the lower left corner of the grid;
#                 set a coordinate to "*" to use the corresponding lower
#                 value from the LAMMPS data file
#    xu, yu, zu : coordinates of the upper right corner of the grid
#                 set a coordinate to "*" to use the corresponding upper
#                 value from the LAMMPS data file
#    deltax, deltay, deltaz : grid spacing in the x, y, z directions
#
#    Notes:
#    (1) Set a coordinate to "*" to use the corresponding lower or upper
#        value (as appropriate) from the LAMMPS data file
#    (2) The coordinate must satisfy: xl ≤ xu, yl ≤ yu, zl ≤ zu
#        - Flat grids, or grids along a line are allowed.
#        - In the event that two coordinates are equal (e.g. yl=yu),
#          the number of grid points along that direction must be one
#          (e.g. if yl=yu, then ngridy=1)
