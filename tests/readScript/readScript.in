# Input file for MDStressLab++ to generate the Cauchy stress field
# on a grid for a configuration read in from a LAMMPS data file using
# an interatomic potential from the OpenKIM repository.
#
# Calculations will be accelerated using OpenMP parallelism if available.
# To specify the number of threads, set the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS
# If not set, all available processors will be used.

### START OF REQUIRED INPUT ###

# The filename of the atomic configuration (simulation cell and atoms)
# in LAMMPS data file # form for which the Cauchy stress is to be computed,
# optionally followed by a second filename containing the reference
# configuration for the first configuration:
#    current.lmp [reference.lmp]
#
#    where
#               current.lmp   : name of file cotaining the current
#                               (deformation) configuration
#               reference.lmp : name of file cotaining the reference
#                               configuration [optional]
#
# If only one filename is specified, it is assumed to be both the reference
# and # current configurations

# Number of grids on which to compute stress

# For each grid the following three lines are read:
#
#    style domain args
#    xl  yl  zl  xu  yu  zu  deltax deltay deltaz
#    file-prefix
#
# where
#
#    style = method for computing force decomposition:
#            `project` : local projection
#            `chain' : chain rule
#    domain  = type of averaging domain:
#              `sphere` : spherical averaging domain
#              `ldad` : averaging domain commensurate with reference
#                       crystal structure
#      `sphere` args = size
#      `ldad` args = type args2
#          type = approach used to define ldad cell:
#                 `fcc' : fcc crystal structure
#                 `bcc' : bcc crystal structure
#                 `lat': lattice vectors
#          'fcc' or 'bcc' args2 = latparam l m n p q r s t u
#          'lat' args2 = l1x l1y l1z l2x l2y l2z l3x l3y l3z l m n p q r s t u
#
#    where
#       size = averaging domain size for spherical domain.
#       latparam = lattice paramater
#       [l m n] [p q r] [s t u] = reference lattice crystallographic
#               directions parallel to the global x,y, and z axes.
#       [l1x l1y l1z] [l2x l2y l2z] [l3x l3y l3z] = coordinates of the
#               three lattice vectors spanning the averaging domain.
#       xl  yl  zl = coordinates of the lower left corner of the grid;
#                    set a coordinate to "*" to use the corresponding lower
#                    value from the LAMMPS data file
#       xu  yu  zu = coordinates of the upper right corner of the grid
#                    set a coordinate to "*" to use the corresponding upper
#                    value from the LAMMPS data file
#       deltax, deltay, deltaz : grid spacing in the x, y, z directions
#       file-prefix = Output filename prefix. MDStressLab will generate an
#                     output file for each provided grid.
#                     The names of these files will begin with the provided
#                     prefix, appended by a "_gridXX" where "XX" is the grid
#                     number.
#
#    Notes:
#    (1) Set a coordinate to "*" to use the corresponding lower or upper
#        value (as appropriate) from the LAMMPS data file
#    (2) The coordinate must satisfy: xl ≤ xu, yl ≤ yu, zl ≤ zu
#        - Flat grids, or grids along a line are allowed.
